I cant seem to focus
And you dont seem to notice Im not here
Im just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflections all alone
I had to go


Cant you hear me
Im not comin home
Do you understand
Ive changed my plans


Cause I Im in love
With my future
Cant wait to meet her
And I  Im in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself


I know supposedly Im lonely now 
Know Im supposed to be unhappy
Without someone 
But arent I someone 
Id  like to be your answer 
Cause youre so handsome 


But I know better
Than to drive you home
Cause youd invite me in
And Id be yours again


But I  Im in love 
With my future
And you dont know her 
And I Im in love 
But not with anybody here
Ill see you in a couple years
